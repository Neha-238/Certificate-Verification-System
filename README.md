# Certificate-Verification-System
The Certificate Verification System is
designed to streamline the process of
issuing and verifying internship
certificates. This web application enables
administrators to upload student data
via an Excel sheet, which includes details
such as certificate ID, student name,
internship domain, and internship start
and end dates. Once the data is
uploaded, students can search for their
certificate using their certificate ID. The
system then displays their certificate

with all the relevant information pre-
filled and allows students to download it.

This project leverages the MERN stack
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and
Node.js) to ensure efficient data handling
and a seamless user experience.
